# How I'm going to learn JavaScript

My approach is **project-based learning**. You can find below the list of projects I've done in order to review basic concepts.

To run those project, use the command `node filename.js` or just open the `html` file in your browser.

The list below links to the `html` files but feel free to check the `.js` files which contain the logic behind the webpage.

1. [me.html](me.html), a simple website that takes user input and shows them on the page.
2. [circle.html](circle.html), a website and a JS file that compute informations about a circle given user input.
3. [todo.html](todo.html), a website which implements a simple version of a todo list app.

## Project ideas 

- A calculator in the browser that supports addition, substraction, multiplication and division
- A currency converter (using an API to get the value of a currency in real time)
