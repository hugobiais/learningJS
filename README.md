# How I'm going to learn JavaScript

My approach is **project-based learning**. You can find below the list of projects I've done in order to review basic concepts.

To run those project, use the command `node filename.js` or just open the `html` file in your browser

1. [me.html](me.html), a simple website that takes user input and shows them on the page.
2. [circle.html](circle.html) and [circle.js](circle.js), a website and a JS file that compute informations about a circle given user input.
